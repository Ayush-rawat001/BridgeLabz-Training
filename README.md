🧠 Technical Concepts Learned (Basics)

SDK (Software Development Kit):
Learned the basic idea that an SDK is a collection of tools like CLI, libraries, and runtime used to build applications.

Foundations of .NET:
Understood the basics of .NET as a cross-platform framework, including:

CLR (Common Language Runtime)

BCL (Base Class Library)

Java vs C#:
Learned basic differences such as:

Java runs on JVM

C# runs on CLR

Compiler vs Interpreter:
Learned the basic concept:

Compiler translates whole code at once

Interpreter translates code line by line

💻 C# Problem Solving (Basic Level)

Practiced basic logic-building problems

Solved introductory problems to understand syntax and flow of C#

🧠 Technical Concepts Learned (Basic Level)

Architecture of .NET:
Learned the basic structure of .NET and how different components work together.

Data Types in C#:
Understood basic data types such as int, double, char, string, and bool.

Operators in C#:
Learned basic operators like arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

CLR and Compiler in .NET:
Learned the role of:

CLR (Common Language Runtime) for execution

Compiler for converting source code into intermediate language

static void Main Keyword:
Understood that Main is the entry point of a C# program and the role of static and void.

Implemented a basic C# program to understand type conversion between different data types.

Assignments Completed: Successfully completed 28 coding questions covering various C# concepts.

# 📘 C# Learning & Problem-Solving Journey

This repository tracks my structured progress in C#, focusing on core language concepts and hands-on coding challenges.  
Each day includes **concept building**, **revision**, and **real coding practice**, followed by pushing solutions to GitHub.

## 🗓️ Progress Timeline

### 📅 20 December 2025
**Technical Focus**
- Understanding C# access levels: `private`, `public`, `internal`, `protected`, `private protected`, `protected internal`
- How C# manages memory internally (Stack vs Heap)

**Hands-On Tasks**
- Practice questions on access modifiers
- Push solutions to GitHub

---

### 📅 21 December 2025 (Weekend – Sunday)
**Daily Plan**
- Quick concept recap
- Solve LeetCode Problem #9: *Palindrome Number*
- Implement logic and commit to GitHub

---

### 📅 22 December 2025
**Concept Exploration**
- Program decision flow: `if-else`, `else-if`, `switch`
- Looping techniques: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`

**Problem Practice**
- 18 Beginner-level challenges
- 12 Intermediate-level challenges
- 6 Advanced-level challenges
- Commit and push all implementations

---

**Coding Tasks**
- 10 array problems → save under *Level 1 of csharp-arrays*
- Push to GitHub

---

### 📅 24 December 2025
**Concept Set**
- Custom method creation
- Making methods more flexible using parameters
- Recursive calls and base conditions
- Static utility methods
- Built-in helpers like `System.Math`

**Coding Practice**
- 10 array problems → add to *Level 2 of csharp-arrays*

- Commit and push all

---

### 📅 25 December 2025 
**Revision Day**
- Refresh all previously learned concepts

**Challenge Goals**
- 12 method problems → push to *Level 2 of csharp-methods*
- 13 method problems → push to *Level 3 of csharp-methods*
- Push all to GitHub

---

### 📅 26 December 2025
**Learning Topics**
- String handling and input
- Using escape characters (`\"`, `\n`, `\t`)
- Passing strings into methods
- String collections and arrays
- Built-in string functions
- ASCII values and character codes
- Exception basics and categories

**Projects & Problems**
- Implement a *Snake and Ladder* game (scenario-based)
- 11 string problems → save to *csharp-strings*
- Push progress to GitHub

---

### 📅 27 December 2025
**Revision Focus**
- Strengthen understanding of string operations

**Practice Target**
- 12 extra string problems → push to *extra-csharp-strings*
- Commit and push

---

### 📅 28 December 2025 
**Revision Day**
- Go through all previous topics briefly

**Practice Goals**
- 13 problems on built-in C# helpers → push to *extra-csharp-built-in*
- Commit and push all solutions

---

## 🚀 Learning Approach
- **Concept first, code next**
- Each feature is practiced via real problems
- All working code is committed and version-controlled
- Goal is to build both understanding + implementation strength

---

## 🧩 Key Areas Practiced
- 🔐 Access Modifiers
- 🧠 Stack vs Heap Memory
- 🔁 Control Flow & Loops
- 📊 Arrays (1D & 2D)
- 🛠️ User-Defined & Recursive Methods
- 🔢 System Library & Math Helpers
- 📝 Strings & ASCII
- ⚠️ Exception Types & Handling
- 🎮 Scenario-based Mini Projects
