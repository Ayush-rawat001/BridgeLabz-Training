🧠 Technical Concepts Learned (Basics)

SDK (Software Development Kit):
Learned the basic idea that an SDK is a collection of tools like CLI, libraries, and runtime used to build applications.

Foundations of .NET:
Understood the basics of .NET as a cross-platform framework, including:

CLR (Common Language Runtime)

BCL (Base Class Library)

Java vs C#:
Learned basic differences such as:

Java runs on JVM

C# runs on CLR

Compiler vs Interpreter:
Learned the basic concept:

Compiler translates whole code at once

Interpreter translates code line by line

💻 C# Problem Solving (Basic Level)

Practiced basic logic-building problems

Solved introductory problems to understand syntax and flow of C#



📅 Date: 19 December 2025

🧠 Technical Concepts Learned (Basic Level)

Architecture of .NET:
Learned the basic structure of .NET and how different components work together.

Data Types in C#:
Understood basic data types such as int, double, char, string, and bool.

Operators in C#:
Learned basic operators like arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

CLR and Compiler in .NET:
Learned the role of:

CLR (Common Language Runtime) for execution

Compiler for converting source code into intermediate language

static void Main Keyword:
Understood that Main is the entry point of a C# program and the role of static and void.

Implemented a basic C# program to understand type conversion between different data types.

Assignments Completed: Successfully completed 28 coding questions covering various C# concepts.

# 📘 C# Learning & Problem-Solving Journey

This repository tracks my structured progress in C#, focusing on core language concepts and hands-on coding challenges.  
Each day includes **concept building**, **revision**, and **real coding practice**, followed by pushing solutions to GitHub.
